I'm not sure when my parents fell in love with the serenity and purity of icy places, but I was lucky enough to be dragged along for a family adventure to the frozen desert of Antarctica. Before departure, I picked up Yuval Noah Harari's *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* as recommended by a classmate. The book not only kept me entertained on the 4 day round trip crossing Drake's Passage, it also confirmed the feeling of bewildered alienation I had throughout the trip. Humans often boast about how big our brains swelled over 3 million years, but after interacting with the Antarctican wild life for two weeks up close, I can't help but wonder if the gyrus folds in our cortex are taking humanity down the wrong path.

With the help of Dr. Harari, let's quickly set up the scene: a single female ape had two daughters six million years ago, one became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other became our ancestor. Then two million years ago, earth became home to to several human species. Things get interesting when our evoling biological machinery decided to shift resources from building muscles to neurons, meaning we couldn't compete against chimpanzees for food unless we outsmarted them. Eventually, around 70,000 years ago, our brains became big enough to retain languages, transfer information, and build cultures. Humans decided to believe in rules, religions, and currencies of trade to keep their growing communities in tact as agriculture became their main method of sustaining life. Within a relatively short period of time, the frail relative of chimpanzees that gathered smaller creatures while being hunted by stronger predators, made a leap to the top of the food chain. The earth's ecological system had always been able to regulate its species so no one destroyed the delicate balance of life, but the humans rose so rapidly that both the ecosystem and humans ourselves failed to adjust. 

Antarctica remained clean -> antartica history 

**"But did we decrease the amount of suffering in the world? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other animals."**

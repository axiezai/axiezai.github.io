I successfully defended by my Ph.D in early November 2021. Towards the end of the almost 3 hour ordeal, the question of my next steps came up, to which I responded along the lines of:"Even though my initial goal was to be a professor, I've come to have a few gripes about academia". Immediately after, my committee had a few sarcastic comments and laughs about "how great academia is". Here, I will share a few things that are not apparent to aspiring academics.

## The Good
I had the priviledge of joining a well funded lab at a R1 institution, and my professor was very hands off. This is certainly not the case for all graduate students. In this environment, I had plenty of space and time to explore the academic landscape. My professor never questioned my decisions to attend conferences, hackathons, or even create a [data science course for the graduate school](https://wcm-datascibasics.github.io/). While everyone in the lab had deadlines to meet, nobody ever felt pressured to work over time or be called upon at unreasonable hours. I was able to explore my own interests during my off time, pick up new hobbies, and even take a totally ridiculous trip to Antarctica on a whim with my family. 

The graduate school offered a wide array of seminars to expand the scientific perspectives of students and faculty. My thesis work was focused on neuroimaging and network theories of brain activity, but there was no shortage of neuroscience seminars to keep me refreshed and curious about topics outside of my lab. I was also lucky enough to enroll in a collaborative institution with many like-minded students. Some times institutions push students to compete, students in the same classes do not get along, or labs are fearful of their new work being "scooped" by another. I had no problems establishing good relationships with cordial professors or bonding with fellow students. 

Out of my neuroscience class of nine students, only two are continuing in academia.


## Pressure
The situation was best summarized by one of my classmates pursuing a Post-doctoral position: 

Columbia student strikes -> doesn't end at the postdoc level
noah's conversation

## Mentoring
prof vs project managers

## Publishing

Hello, readers, look at your rubber band, now back to my rubber band, now back at your rubber band, now back to mine. Sadly, your rubber band isn't as cool as mine, but if your rubber band understood graph theory, it could be as cool as mine. Look down, back up, where are you? You're inside a brain with your rubber band. What's in your hand? Back at me, I have it, it's a spectral clustering algorithm. Look again, the brain's connected by my cool rubber bands. Scientific data analysis can be made simple with rubber bands! [I'm imaginging Old Spice commercials.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE)

It's common practice for people to bundle together our messy hair together with rubber bands. It turns out, this simple act of using elasticity to hold multiple objects together is exactly the same approach scientists use to group together messy sets of data. Here, I'd like to show some cool brains as an introduction to spectral clustering, and explain how a popular clustering algorithm can be simply viewed as perturbations of rubber bands.

Engineers have become quite masterful at manipulating powerful magnets to capture images of our insides. By carefully following the movement of water molecules inside our brains, we can visualize the fiber tracts connecting specialized brain regions quite clearly. Despite the artsy images and fancy technology, there is something meaningful in the series of numbers representing pairwise connection strength between numerous brain regions of interest.
